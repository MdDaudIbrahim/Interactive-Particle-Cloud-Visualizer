## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* Node.js (e.g., v18.x or higher) - _(Specify version if critical)_

1. No installation needed. Open index.html in your browser.

_**(AI Suggested)** Remember to verify these steps. You might need to add repository cloning, directory navigation, or environment variable setup._

For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MdDaudIbrahim/Interactive-Particle-Cloud-Visualizer
cd Interactive-Particle-Cloud-Visualizer
# ... (AI suggested steps like npm install, pip install, etc.) ...
# cp .env.example .env (if applicable)

**Example:**
```javascript
// Illustrate how to use a core function or start the application
// import { coreFunction } from './src/myModule'; // Adjust path as needed

async function main() {
  console.log("Starting Interactive-Particle-Cloud-Visualizer...");
  // const result = await coreFunction({ param1: 'value1' });
  // console.log('Project Output:', result);

  // For a web server example:
  // const app = require('./server'); // or import if using ES modules
  // const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  // app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));
}

main();
